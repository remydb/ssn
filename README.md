This repository holds a python prototype for an SSN project about digital traitor tracing.
We try to achieve this by adding encoded user information to files as they are downloaded from a samba share.

This prototype will use other open-source tools to add the actual information to the downloaded files, the python script located in this git repo will merely serve as a way to encode and feed information to these seperate programs.
